Make an HTML file that calls the Leaflet JavaScript library to display the map of Volzhsky on the user’s screen. 
Provide facilities for the user to click on the map and select two points (source and destination). Open a pop-up that 
displays the coordinates selected by the user and provide the “Save” button.
Deliverable: said HTML file.
